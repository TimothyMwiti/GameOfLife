# GameOfLife

Simple Implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) using the [OneLoneCoder olcPixelGameEngine](https://github.com/OneLoneCoder/olcPixelGameEngine)
which draws directly to the console.

This concept was used as an example of how a system setup with simple rules can be simulated and produce very complex patterns as it progresses. Think Simulation Theory ;)
